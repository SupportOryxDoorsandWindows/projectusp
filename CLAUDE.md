# Notes for Claude

## Product families (Master Inventory)

Item descriptions start with a product-family prefix. They are different
product lines — never treat one family's item as a match for another's:

| Prefix | Product |
|---|---|
| `SMB1` (also written `SMB`) | **Smartscreen** |
| `ZLS1` (also written `ZLS`) | **Flyscreen** |

- A ZLS1 part with no ZLS1 record in Master Inventory is a **new item** to be
  added (e.g. "ZLS1 Drawbar Cap 01 Right/ Black", "ZLS1 Drawbar Cap 01 Left/
  Black" from Freedom invoices) — not a match for the SMB1 or ZLX item with a
  similar name.
- The Check-in description matcher (`findUniqueDescriptionItem` in
  `fp-pro.js`) never auto-matches across a series-number difference
  ("ZLS" vs "ZLS1"). Such a match is only offered as a "Possible match —
  Use this item" suggestion (`findSeriesSuggestion`), because deciding that
  two names are the same part is the stock team's call, not the system's.
  It never suggests across families or across different series numbers.
- A second suggestion pass (`findCloseSuggestion`) covers supplier names
  that use a different product word, e.g. Freedom's "ZLS1-Infinity
  60mm-IS( 2.9m)Mill" for Master's "ZLS1 Housing 60 IS 01 MILL" (2900 mm).
  Family, size, side/colour/finish and the stated bar length must all agree;
  only one product word may differ, and a tie suggests nothing. It is never
  auto-applied. Known family words live in `PRODUCT_FAMILIES`.
- ZLS1 profiles have one Master row per bar length (2500 / 2900 / 5100 mm)
  under the same code, so anything that resolves a Check-in row must pick the
  exact length row by id, not just the code.

## Currency (Check-in)

- `detectDocumentCurrencyInfo` in `fp-pro.js`: a written code or code-marked
  symbol (USD, AUD, US$, A$…) wins; a bare "$" uses Australia-only markers
  (ABN, Pty Ltd, Australia, .com.au — not GST, which India also uses) or US
  markers; a bare "$" with no markers is never assumed (never AED) — the
  Check-in screen asks USD or AUD and Confirm stays locked until answered.
- The AED rate comes from the fawazahmed0 currency-api on jsDelivr, for the
  invoice date first, then latest, then the last rate on file.
