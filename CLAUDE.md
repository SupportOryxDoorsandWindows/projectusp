# Notes for Claude

## Product families (Master Inventory)

Item descriptions start with a product-family prefix. They are different
product lines — never treat one family's item as a match for another's:

| Prefix | Product |
|---|---|
| `SMB1` (also written `SMB`) | **Smartscreen** |
| `ZLS1` (also written `ZLS`) | **Flyscreen** |

- A ZLS1 part with no ZLS1 record in Master Inventory is a **new item** to be
  added (e.g. "ZLS1 Drawbar Cap 01 Right/ Black", "ZLS1 Drawbar Cap 01 Left/
  Black" from Freedom invoices) — not a match for the SMB1 or ZLX item with a
  similar name.
- The Check-in description matcher (`findUniqueDescriptionItem` in
  `fp-pro.js`) treats "ZLS" and "ZLS1" as the same family word, but never
  matches across families or across different series numbers.
